## How to Run our Program

Everything you need to run the program is already pre-installed. The only package that you are missing is textblob that is used for sentiment analysis. In order to download this package you will need to use the pip command in terminal as follows 
`pip install --user textblob`
This will allow you to simply run the program through the jupyter notebook.
